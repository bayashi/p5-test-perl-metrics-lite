NAME
    Test::Perl::Metrics::Lite - Use Perl::Metrics::Lite in test programs

SYNOPSIS
    Basic usage.

      use Test::Perl::Metrics::Lite;
      all_metrics_ok();

    You can change the metrics threshold.

      use Test::Perl::Metrics::Lite (-mccabe_complexity => 20, -loc => 100);
      all_metrics_ok();

    Exclude some files with except_file option

      use Test::Perl::Metrics::Lite (
          -except_file => [
              'lib/SomeClass.pm',
              'lib/SomeDir/SomeClass.pm'
           ]
      );
      all_metrics_ok();

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Perl::Metrics::Lite wraps the Perl::Metrics::Lite engine in a
    convenient subroutine suitable for test programs written using the
    Test::More framework

    This makes it easy to integrate metrics enforcement into the build
    process.

    Mccabe complexity theshold is 10 and the lines of code theshold is 60.
    all_metrics_ok() test is failed when metrics exceed threshold values
    relative to the baseline.
